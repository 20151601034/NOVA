About this code
===============

This is a prerelease of the NOVA microhypervisor. This code is experimental
and not feature complete. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

Building from source code
=========================

You need the following tools to compile the source code.

* make 3.81
  available from http://www.gnu.org/software/make/

* gcc 3.4 or higher 
  available from http://gcc.gnu.org/

* binutils 2.18.50.0.7 or higher
  available from http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/binutils/

You can build the binary as follows:

$ cd build; make

Booting
=======

The NOVA microhypervisor can be started from a multiboot-compliant
bootloader, such as GRUB or PXEGRUB. Here are some examples:

# Boot from harddisk 0, partition 0
title       NOVA
kernel      (hd0,0)/boot/tftp/nova/hypervisor
module      (hd0,0)/...
...

# Boot from TFTP server aa.bb.cc.dd
title	    NOVA
tftpserver  aa.bb.cc.dd
kernel	    (nd)/tftp/nova/hypervisor
module      (nd)/...
...

Supported platforms
===================

NOVA runs on 32-bit Intel and AMD machines that support ACPI.

The virtualization features are available on:

* Intel CPUs with VMX
  regardless of whether the CPU supports nested paging (EPT) or not.

* AMD CPUs with SVM
  only when the CPU supports nested paging (NPT).

Issues
======

The following is a list of issues you may encounter.

* The code fails to compile.
  Make sure your gcc and binutils meet the minimum requirements listed
  above. If the problem persists, then let us know.

* Virtualization is not supported when running under QEMU.
  QEMU implements SVM, but does not support NPT. Therefore, it does not meet
  the platform requirements.

* The roottask fails to start and prints a "bad elf" message.
  Ensure the roottask is linked such that it does not use a BSS. When
  running "objdump -p" on the roottask binary, filesz must be equal to memsz
  for all loadable sections.

* The revoke hypercall is currently unavailable.

Feedback
========

Feedback should be sent to <udo@hypervisor.org>.
